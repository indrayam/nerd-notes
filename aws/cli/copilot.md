## Why?
The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release and operate production-ready containerized applications on AWS App Runner or Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.

Use Copilot to:

- Deploy production-ready, scalable services on AWS from a Dockerfile in one command
- Add databases or inject secrets to your services
- Grow from one microservice to a collection of related microservices in an application
- Set up test and production environments, across regions and accounts
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to release your services to your environments
- Monitor and debug your services from your terminal
